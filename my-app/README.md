### How to run the Question's management app 🌈 ?
Well, it's fairly simple.

1. Run `npm install` to install all the required dependencies.
2. Then, Run `npm start` to run the app.

By default, the app runs on port 3000. So, please make sure the port is available.

First time, it may take few seconds to start the server.

If everything goes well, you should be able to see the fancy application on http://localhost:3000/
